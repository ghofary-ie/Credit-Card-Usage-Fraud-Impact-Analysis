# Credit-Card-Usage-Fraud-Impact-Analysis

Project Background
RevoBank, a leading bank in Indonesia, aims to increase the usage of its credit card products among existing customers. As a data analyst working with the Performance Management (PM) team, the goal is to analyze customer transaction data over the past six months to better understand customer behavior and identify key segments for targeted marketing efforts.
The bank earns revenue from credit card transactions through a Merchant Discount Rate (MDR) fee, which results in a profit margin of 1.5% per transaction amount. However, fraudulent transactions can significantly impact the bankâ€™s net income, as RevoBank absorbs the full cost of any fraud incurred.
This project involves summarizing transaction performance, calculating gross and net income after fraud, and developing user personas based on transaction patterns and fraud risk. The insights generated will support the PM team in creating effective strategies to encourage increased card usage and reduce fraud-related losses.
